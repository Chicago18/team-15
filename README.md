## In service of CMAA (Chinese Mutual Aid Association)

CMAA is a non-profit organization that provides after-school events and supplemental educational programming for low-income children of immigrants in Chicago. This is an application that allows parents who are interested in enrolling their kids into CMAA's program to easily fill out the appropriate enrollment forms by providing alternate language functionality. Additionally, it allows parents to check their students' grades and progress. Students who access the website can log in and do exercises and additional problems to enhance their learning experience in school. Teachers and administrators, in the future, will be able to create and upload additional exercises for their students.

Currently, there is a game available for students to play to practice learning about nouns, verbs, and adjectives.(NOTE: This game currently does not work in Chrome. If you would like to play, please use Firefox, IE, Edge, or some other web browser to test the game.)
