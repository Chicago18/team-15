This is a web-based application that allows parents who are interested in enrolling their kids into CMAA's program to easily fill out the appropriate enrollment forms by providing alternate language functionality. It also allows parents to check their students' grades and progress. It is also an application that allows kids to log in and do exercises and additional problems to enhance their learning experience in school. Teachers and administrators, in the future, will be able to create and upload additional exercises for their students.

Currently, there is a game available for students to play to practice learning about nouns, verbs, and adjectives. This game currently does not work in Chrome. If you would like to play, please use Firefox, IE, Edge, or some other web browser to test the game.
